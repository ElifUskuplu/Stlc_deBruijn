# STLC with de Bruijn in Lean4
Simply Typed Lambda Calculus with de Bruijn indices in Lean4

The project is based on the paper "The Locally Nameless Representation" by Arthur CharguÂ´eraud. I mostly used his Coq library when I formalize the stuff in Lean4.

Current notes:
1) We provide the proof of the confluence.
2) We also aim to formalize strong normalization in addition to confluence.
